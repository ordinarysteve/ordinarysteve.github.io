## Introduction

Thank you for using **NopeBot**, a WhatsApp bot designed to bring fun and utility to your WhatsApp groups. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting the information you share with us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your data.

   - Command requests (e.g., `!guessflag`, `!ping`, `!warn`)
   - Responses from the bot
   - Game actions or responses

2. **User Profile Data**: We may store your WhatsApp ID (which is unique to each user) and data related to the games you play, such as:
   - Games played
   - Warnings issued (for admin commands)
   - Daily game limits

NopeBot does not collect personal data like your real name, phone number, or other identifiable information, unless explicitly shared by you in the course of the interaction.

## Data Storage and Security

NopeBot stores your data securely and ensures that only authorized administrators can access sensitive information (such as warnings or game stats). We do not share, sell, or transfer your data to third parties without your consent, except as required by law.

Data is retained for as long as necessary to maintain the bot's functionality and improve the user experience. You can request the deletion of your data by contacting the bot administrators.
